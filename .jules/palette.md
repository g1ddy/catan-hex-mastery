## 2024-05-23 - Confusing Icon Semantics
**Learning:** Reusing specific resource icons (like "Trees" for Wood) to represent generic "Total Resources" creates semantic confusion and accessibility barriers. Users may mistake the total count for a specific resource count.
**Action:** Use generic icons (like "Layers" or "Stack") for aggregate counts, and always provide an aria-label for icon-only or icon-heavy summaries.
