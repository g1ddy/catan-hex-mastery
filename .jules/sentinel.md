## 2024-05-24 - Integer Precision & Validation
**Vulnerability:** Input validation for hex coordinates (`isValidHexId`) accepted unsafe integers (e.g. `2^53 + 1`) due to JavaScript's floating point precision loss during parsing. The precision loss effectively "corrected" the unsafe input into a safe but incorrect value, bypassing logical checks.
**Learning:** `JSON.parse` or `Number()` conversion happens *before* your logic sees the data. If the input format allows numbers larger than `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, the runtime will silently modify them. Logic like `q + r + s === 0` is insufficient if `q` has already been altered by precision loss.
**Prevention:** Always use `Number.isSafeInteger()` when parsing numbers from external or untrusted sources (like URL params or user input) that are expected to be integers, especially when those numbers are used as IDs or logic keys.
